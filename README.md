ECE 5745 Tutorial 5: Synopsys/Cadence ASIC Tools
==========================================================================

This repository contains the code and documentation for ECE 5745 Tutorial
5 on the Synopsys/Cadence ASIC tools. This tutorial discusses the various
views that make-up a standard-cell library and then illustrates how to
use the Synopsys/Cadence ASIC tools to map an RTL design down to these
standard cells and ultimately silicon. The tutorial discusses the key
tools used for synthesis, place-and-route, and power analysis. This
tutorial requires entering commands manually for each of the tools to
enable students to gain a better understanding of the detailed steps
involved in this process. The next tutorial will illustrate how this
process can be automated to facilitate rapid design-space exploration.
This tutorial assumes you have already completed the tutorials on Linux,
Git, PyMTL, and Verilog.
